digits in it.
def count_letters_digits(sentence):

        elif c.isdigit():
            digit_count += 1
    # Return the counts
    return letter_count, digit_count

# Test the function with a sample sentence

OR QUESTION Write a python program to create a class Circle and compute the area and the 
circumference of the Circle. (Use parameterized constructor).
import math
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
    
    def area(self):
        return math.pi * self.radius**2
    def circumference(self):
        return 2 * math.pi * self.radius
# Create a circle object with radius 5
circle = Circle(5)
# Compute and display the area and circumference of the circle
print(f'Area: {circle.area()}')
print(f'Circumference: {circle.circumference()}')
