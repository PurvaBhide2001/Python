Q,1]10 MARKS  Write a python program to find the length of a set. (Donâ€™t use built in function len)


def set_length(s):
    # Initialize a counter
    count = 0
    # Iterate through the set
    for _ in s:
        # Increment the counter
        count += 1
    # Return the counter
    return count

# Test the function with a sample set

OR QUESTION Define a class named Rectangle which can be constructed by a length and width. The
Rectangle class has amethod which can compute the area and perimeter. Display area and 
perimeter. Also delete the object.

class Rectangle:
    def _init_(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width
    
    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
    
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * (self.length + self.width)
    
    def _del_(self):
        print('Rectangle object deleted')

# Create a rectangle object
rect = Rectangle(5, 6)

# Compute and display the area and perimeter
print(f'Area: {rect.area()}')
print(f'Perimeter: {rect.perimeter()}')

# Delete the rectangle object
del rect
