Q.2]20 MARKS  Write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common 
between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two lists of different 
sizes. 

def common_elements(list1, list2):
  # Convert the lists to sets and find the intersection
  common_set = set(list1) & set(list2)
  
  # Convert the set back to a list and return it
  return list(common_set)

# Test the function with two lists of different sizes
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(common_elements(list1, list2))

Display line numbers which contain given word and total occurrences of it.


import sys

  # Initialize the line number and the count
  line_number = 0

  # Open the file
  with open(filename, 'r') as file:
    # Iterate over each line in the file
    for line in file:
      # Increment the line number
      line_number += 1
      
      # Split the line into a list of words
      words = line.split()
      
      # Iterate over each word in the line
      for w in words:
        # If the word matches the search word, increment the count
        if w == word:
          count += 1
          # Print the line number
          print("Line", line_number, ":", line.strip())

# Get the file name and the search word from the command line
filename = sys.argv[1]
word = sys.argv[2]

# Call the find_word function
find_word(filename, word)
